The purpose of this section is to show how the hardware deployment for our system has been designed. 
Each node represented is physical and it possibly has a given execution environment and different components related to the various functionalities it offers or has access to.
The reasons for our decisions are briefly listed here:
1) The three-tiers architecture is a good compromise between security and complexity, keeping the presentation, application and data layers separated. This also permits a more coherent implementation of the MVC design pattern.
2) The system has been deployed on different physical nodes in order to avoid overloads.
3) The external API services have been modeled as a single external node for simplicity.
