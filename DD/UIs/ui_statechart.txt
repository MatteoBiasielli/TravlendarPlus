The following statechart highlights the most relevant connections between the different UIs presented into the RASD, with the correspondent notation. Specifically, the major points to notice are:
1) From the Calendar Dayview Interface, which is the first interface the users are presented after the login, they can reach all the main functionalities of Travlendar+.
2) The condition of the Calendar Interfaces macrostate is always preserved, that is, if for instance one user decides to create an activity from one of the Calendar Interfaces and then to switch to the Preferences Interface to set up some constraints, when switching back to the Calendar Interfaces he or she will still be presented the Activity Creation Interface, thus preserving any data that was inserted. This explains the meaning of the arrows connected to the whole macrostate instead of the single microstates.
3) The "accessed from..." states serve to keep track of the interface from which a given functionality was accessed, so that the users will then be brought back to the correct interface. The core functionality accessed from those states, though, is still the same.
4) Some interfaces have been omitted for simplicity, such as the distincted ones for fixed and flexible activities creation. This is because there are very few differences between them, so they can be treated as the same from the point of view of this statechart.
